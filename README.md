 Mercenary Revive Mod for Heroes of Hammerwatch

This is very work in progress, currently enabling this mod and loading any character at the character select will cause you to load in as a deceased mercenary. At this point you can use the unlock_mercenary command to "revive" that mercenary. Then log out to the main menu and repeat as needed. 

One day I'd like to work this concept into something more userfriendly, the fact that the character select screen opens on launch is part of that, but currently it doesn't do much. 

Happy for anyone who wants to, to pick up work on this.
